    "## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming: A Quick Refresher\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive deeper into advanced OOP patterns for AI applications, let's establish a common foundation. If you've been following along from the beginning of this chapter, some of these concepts will be familiar, but we'll approach them from a slightly different angle, with particular emphasis on inheritance and polymorphism—two concepts that become especially powerful when building scalable AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Four Core Concepts: Your OOP Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming is built around four fundamental principles: **encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism**. Think of these as the four pillars that support everything you build with OOP. We've already explored encapsulation and abstraction in earlier sections, but let's briefly revisit them before focusing more deeply on inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation** is about bundling data and the methods that operate on that data together, while hiding internal details. When you create a medical diagnosis model, you encapsulate its internal parameters, training history, and prediction logic within the model object. External code doesn't need to know how the model calculates probabilities internally—it just calls `predict()` and gets results. This is encapsulation at work: presenting a clean interface while keeping complexity hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** takes this further by exposing only what's essential. A self-driving car's control system abstracts away the complexity of sensor fusion, path planning, and motor control behind simple interfaces like \"accelerate\" and \"brake.\" Similarly, when you use a pre-trained transformer model, you don't need to understand attention mechanisms or layer normalization—you just call the model with your input and receive predictions. Abstraction allows you to work at a higher level without getting lost in implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance** and **polymorphism** are where OOP really shines for building complex AI systems, and we'll be focusing heavily on these concepts in the upcoming sections. Inheritance allows you to create specialized versions of existing classes, inheriting their functionality while adding or modifying specific behaviors. Polymorphism enables different objects to respond to the same method calls in their own way, making your code more flexible and reusable. We'll explore these in depth shortly, but for now, remember that inheritance is about building hierarchies of related concepts, while polymorphism is about using those related objects interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Objects: The Blueprint and the Building\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the distinction between classes and objects is fundamental. Let's make it crystal clear with an analogy that works well for AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is like a template, a blueprint, or a cookie cutter. It defines the shape and capabilities that objects created from it will have, but it's not an object itself. Think of it as a specification document. When architectural firms design a standardized medical clinic, they create blueprints that specify: \"Every clinic will have a reception area, examination rooms, a laboratory, and storage for medical equipment.\" This blueprint isn't a clinic you can visit—it's the plan for building clinics.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **object** is an actual instance created from that class. It's the real thing you can interact with. Following our analogy, each physical clinic built from those blueprints is an object. One clinic might be in Boston, another in Seattle. They're both built from the same blueprint, but they're different buildings with different patients, different staff, and different equipment. They share the same structure but have their own specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when you write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class AIModel:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.predictions_made = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def predict(self, data):\n",
    "        self.predictions_made += 1\n",
    "        return \"prediction result\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You're defining a class—the blueprint. You're saying: \"Any AIModel will have a name and a prediction count, and any AIModel will be able to make predictions.\" This code doesn't create an actual model; it just defines what an AIModel looks like and what it can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bert_model = AIModel(\"BERT-sentiment\")\n",
    "gpt_model = AIModel(\"GPT-classifier\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You're creating objects—actual instances. Now you have two real models in memory, each with its own name and its own prediction count. They're both AIModels (they follow the same blueprint), but they're distinct entities. When `bert_model` makes a prediction, only its `predictions_made` counter increases. The `gpt_model` is completely unaffected.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction becomes crucial when building AI systems. Your `AIModel` class defines the general concept of what an AI model is and what it can do—common functionality that all models share. But each specific model you create (BERT, GPT, ResNet) is its own object with its own state: its own weights, its own training history, its own performance metrics. The class provides the structure; the objects provide the instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class-Level Definitions vs. Object-Level Data\n",
    "\n",
    "One final crucial point: there's an important distinction between what you define in the class and what gets set in each object. The class defines the structure—what attributes and methods will exist. Each object gets its own copy of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way: the class is like the form that every employee fills out when joining a company. The form has fields for name, department, start date, and salary. Every employee has the same fields (the structure is defined by the form/class), but each employee fills in their own specific information (the data belongs to each object).\n",
    "\n",
    "In code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, department):\n",
    "        self.name = name              # Each object gets its own name\n",
    "        self.department = department  # Each object gets its own department\n",
    "        self.start_date = \"2024-01-01\"  # Same initial value for all, but each object's copy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create employees:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "alice = Employee(\"Alice\", \"AI Research\")\n",
    "bob = Employee(\"Bob\", \"ML Engineering\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Alice and Bob have the same attributes (name, department, start_date) because those are defined in the class. But each has their own values for those attributes. Changing Alice's name doesn't affect Bob's name—they're separate objects with their own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This becomes particularly important in AI systems when you're managing multiple models, multiple experiments, or multiple data processing pipelines. Each needs to maintain its own state independently while sharing the same underlying structure and capabilities defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these fundamentals—how classes define structure, how objects hold data, how attributes and methods work together—sets you up to use the more advanced OOP patterns we'll explore next. With this foundation in place, inheritance and polymorphism will make much more sense, and you'll see how they enable you to build sophisticated, scalable AI systems from well-organized, reusable components."

    "## 1. Encapsulation (review)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition and Core Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encapsulation means bundling data (properties) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit. When parsing receipts with AI, instead of having scattered variables—`receipt_total`, `receipt_tax`, `receipt_items`, `receipt_date`, `receipt_merchant`—we group everything into a `Receipt` object that stores all the parsed data together and provides methods to access and validate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key benefits are:\n",
    "- Organized data: All parsed fields from a receipt stay together in one object\n",
    "- Easier processing: You can pass a single `Receipt` object instead of dozens of individual values\n",
    "- Validation: Check if parsed data makes sense (does subtotal + tax = total?)\n",
    "- Reusability: Receipt objects work across different parts of your parsing pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Parsed Data Together\n",
    "\n",
    "When your AI extracts information from a receipt image or text, you get multiple pieces of data: merchant name, date, line items, subtotal, tax, total, payment method, etc. Rather than keeping these as separate variables, encapsulation groups them into a cohesive object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Receipt:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, receipt_id, raw_text):\n",
    "        # Parsed fields (populated by AI extraction)\n",
    "        self.receipt_id = receipt_id\n",
    "\n",
    "        self.merchant_name = None\n",
    "        self.date = None\n",
    "        self.items = []\n",
    "        self.subtotal = None\n",
    "        self.tax = None\n",
    "        self.total = None\n",
    "        self.payment_method = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now all the data from one receipt stays bundled together. When you process 100 receipts, you have 100 `Receipt` objects, each containing its own complete set of extracted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods for Validation and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation isn't just about storing data—it's also about including methods that operate on that data. For parsed receipts, you need methods to validate the extracted information and derive insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Receipt:\n",
    "    # ... initialization code ... code shown previous but ommitted here for brievety\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    def validate_totals(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Check if parsed totals are mathematically consistent\"\"\"\n",
    "        if self.subtotal is None or self.tax is None or self.total is None:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "        \n",
    "        expected_total = self.subtotal + self.tax\n",
    "        # Allow small rounding differences\n",
    "        return abs(expected_total - self.total) < 0.01\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def get_item_count(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Count number of items on receipt\"\"\"\n",
    "        return len(self.items)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def extract_categories(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Analyze items to determine purchase categories\"\"\"\n",
    "        categories = set()\n",
    "        for item in self.items:\n",
    "            if 'category' in item:\n",
    "                categories.add(item['category'])\n",
    "        return list(categories)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods work with the object's as they don't need you to pass parameters because they already have access to `self.subtotal`, `self.tax`, `self.items`, etc. This is encapsulation: the object knows about itself and can operate on its own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preventing Data Corruption\n",
    "\n",
    "When parsing receipts, you want to ensure the extracted data stays intact and consistent. Encapsulation helps by keeping related data together and protecting it from accidental modification:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Receipt:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, receipt_id, raw_text):\n",
    "        self.receipt_id = receipt_id\n",
    "        self._raw_text = raw_text  # Private - original shouldn't change\n",
    "        self._confidence_scores = {}  # Private - internal tracking\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Public parsed fields\n",
    "        self.merchant_name = None\n",
    "        self.date = None\n",
    "        self.items = []\n",
    "        self.total = None\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def set_field_confidence(self, field_name, confidence):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Track AI extraction confidence internally\"\"\"\n",
    "        self._confidence_scores[field_name] = confidence\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def get_confidence(self, field_name):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Access confidence scores without exposing internal dict\"\"\"\n",
    "        return self._confidence_scores.get(field_name, 0.0)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def is_high_confidence(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Derived method - checks if all key fields were confidently extracted\"\"\"\n",
    "        key_fields = ['merchant_name', 'date', 'total']\n",
    "        return all(self.get_confidence(field) > 0.9 for field in key_fields)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By marking `_raw_text` and `_confidence_scores` as private (with underscore), you signal that external code shouldn't directly manipulate these. The object provides safe ways to interact with this data through methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Building a Receipt Parsing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how encapsulation simplifies a receipt parsing workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Without encapsulation - messy\n",
    "receipt_id = \"R001\"\n",
    "merchant = parse_merchant(image)\n",
    "date = parse_date(image)\n",
    "items = parse_items(image)\n",
    "total = parse_total(image)\n",
    "# ... dozens of variables to track ...\n",
    "\n",
    "# With encapsulation - clean\n",
    "receipt = Receipt(\"R001\", raw_text=image_text)\n",
    "# receipt should contain all the fields described above and the methods needed to operate on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Validate and process\n",
    "if receipt.validate_totals():\n",
    "    database.save(receipt)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    flag_for_manual_review(receipt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All the parsed data stays bundled in the `Receipt` object. You pass one object around your pipeline instead of juggling multiple variables. The object validates itself, knows its own structure, and can be easily stored, retrieved, or analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This organizational approach becomes essential when processing thousands of receipts—each is a self-contained unit with all its data and logic bundled together."

    "## 2. Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition and Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** means showing only essential details and hiding everything else. When you use a receipt parser, you care about getting structured data out—merchant name, date, items, total. You don't need to know whether it's using OCR preprocessing, GPT-4 Vision, regex patterns, or fuzzy text matching internally. That complexity is hidden; you just call the parser and get results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction provides several key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simpler interfaces (function to interact with instances): Instead of needing to understand image preprocessing, model inference, text cleaning, and data extraction, you just call `parser.parse(receipt_image)` and receive a `Receipt` object\n",
    "- Reduces impact of change: You can switch from using GPT-4 to Claude or from cloud APIs to local models without breaking code that uses the parser\n",
    "- Independent development: One developer can work on improving OCR accuracy while another works on the database storage layer, as long as the interface between them stays consistent\n",
    "- Incremental improvements: You can rewrite the entire parsing implementation—maybe moving from rule-based extraction to an AI model—and existing code continues\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface vs Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface is what external code sees and uses—the public methods you can call. The implementation is how those methods actually work internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a receipt parser:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ReceiptParser:\n",
    "    def parse(self, image_path):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Interface: Simple method that external code calls\"\"\"\n",
    "        # Implementation hidden inside\n",
    "        text = self._extract_text(image_path)  # Private method\n",
    "        structured_data = self._parse_fields(text)  # Private method\n",
    "        receipt = self._create_receipt_object(structured_data)  # Private method\n",
    "        return receipt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "External code only needs to know about the `parse()` method (the interface). It doesn't need to know about `_extract_text()`, `_parse_fields()`, or `_create_receipt_object()` (the implementation). Those are marked private with underscores, signaling they're internal details.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means you can completely change the implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ReceiptParser:\n",
    "    def parse(self, image_path):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Same interface, completely different implementation\"\"\"\n",
    "        # Now using an AI model instead of regex\n",
    "        prompt = self._build_prompt(image_path)\n",
    "        ai_response = self._call_gpt4(prompt)\n",
    "        receipt = self._convert_to_receipt(ai_response)\n",
    "        return receipt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Code using the parser doesn't need any changes—the interface (`parse()` method) stayed the same even though the implementation changed completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preventing Tight Coupling\n",
    "\n",
    "When code depends on interfaces rather than implementations, components remain loosely coupled. Imagine you're building a receipt processing pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Parser handles extraction (interface: parse method)\n",
    "parser = ReceiptParser()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Validator checks data quality (interface: validate method)\n",
    "validator = ReceiptValidator()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Storage saves to database (interface: save method)\n",
    "storage = ReceiptStorage()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pipeline uses interfaces, not implementation details\n",
    "receipt = parser.parse(\"receipt.jpg\")\n",
    "if validator.validate(receipt):\n",
    "    storage.save(receipt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline doesn't know (or care) whether the parser uses AI, regex, or manual rules. It doesn't know if the validator checks 5 rules or 50. It doesn't know if storage uses PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or files. Each component hides its complexity behind a simple interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to swap PostgreSQL for MongoDB, you just change the `ReceiptStorage` implementation. The interface (`save()` method) stays the same, so the pipeline code doesn't break. This is abstraction preventing ripple effects—changes stay contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Real Receipt Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two different implementations of receipt parsing with the same interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Simple rule-based implementation\n",
    "class SimpleReceiptParser:\n",
    "    def parse(self, image_path):\n",
    "        # Use keywords, patterns and heuristics\n",
    "        # example find the keyword total and record what's \n",
    "        # after it as total\n",
    "        # Simple but less accurate (\"unrealistic\")\n",
    "        return receipt_object\n",
    "\n",
    "# AI-powered implementation  \n",
    "class AIReceiptParser:\n",
    "    def parse(self, image_path):\n",
    "        # Uses GPT-4 Vision API\n",
    "        # More accurate but slower and costs money\n",
    "        return receipt_object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both have the same `parse()` method, so you can swap them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Start with simple parser for development\n",
    "parser = SimpleReceiptParser()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Later upgrade to AI parser for production\n",
    "parser = AIReceiptParser()\n",
    "\n",
    "# All code using parser.parse() continues working unchanged\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is abstraction in action: hiding complexity behind consistent interfaces, allowing you to evolve your system without breaking existing code."

    "## 3. Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition and Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows you to create specialized classes that build upon existing classes. When parsing receipts with AI, you'll encounter different types: restaurant receipts have tip lines and table numbers to extract, grocery receipts have coupon codes and loyalty card numbers, gas station receipts have fuel grades and gallon amounts. Rather than writing completely separate parsing code for each type, inheritance lets you define common parsing logic once and extend it for specific receipt types.\n",
    "\n",
    "This eliminates redundant code. Every receipt needs to extract merchant name, date, items, and total—you shouldn't rewrite that logic for restaurants, groceries, and gas stations. Write it once in a base class and reuse it everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure: Superclass and Subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "A superclass (or parent class) contains the common attributes and parsing methods shared by all receipt types. A subclass (or child class) inherits everything from the superclass and adds parsing logic for type-specific fields.\n",

    "### Understanding super() and Method Overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super()` function is how child classes access their parent class. When you see `super().__init__(receipt_id, image_path)` in `ServiceReceipt`, it's calling the parent Receipt class's `__init__` method first. This ensures the parent class sets up all the common attributes (receipt_id, image_path, merchant, date, items, etc.) before the child class adds its own specific attributes (tip_amount, server_name).\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `super()`, you'd have to manually duplicate all the parent's initialization code in every child class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Without super() - repetitive\n",
    "class ServiceReceipt(Receipt):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, receipt_id, image_path):\n",
    "        self.receipt_id = receipt_id\n",
    "        self.image_path = image_path\n",
    "        self.merchant = None\n",
    "        self.date = None\n",

    "        self.total = None\n",
    "        # Then add service-specific fields\n",
    "        self.tip_amount = None\n",
    "        self.server_name = None\n",
    "\n",
    "# With super() - clean\n",
    "class ServiceReceipt(Receipt):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, receipt_id, image_path):\n",
    "        super().__init__(receipt_id, image_path)\n",
    "        self.tip_amount = None\n",
    "        self.server_name = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding methods is optional. Notice that `ServiceReceipt` defines its own `print_receipt()` method while `GroceryReceipt` does not. When a child class defines a method with the same name as the parent, it replaces (overrides) the parent's version. But you don't have to override anything—child classes can simply use the parent's methods unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do override a method, you often want to keep the parent's behavior and extend it. That's why `ServiceReceipt.print_receipt()` calls `super().print_receipt()` first to print the common receipt fields, then adds service-specific fields afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Child classes can also add completely new methods that don't exist in the parent. The `validate_tip()` method only exists in `ServiceReceipt` because only restaurant receipts have tips to validate. The parent `Receipt` class and the `GroceryReceipt` class don't have this method—it's specific to service receipts.\n",

    "        receipt.calculate_total()\n",

    "### When Methods Share Names But Behave Differently\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to polymorphism is that methods share the same name and interface but can have completely different implementations. For receipts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `calculate_total()` exists in all receipt classes, but restaurant receipts add tips, grocery receipts subtract savings, and basic receipts just add tax\n",
    "- `get_summary()` exists in all receipt classes, but each formats the output differently based on what information matters for that receipt type\n",
    "- External code just calls these methods without worrying about the details\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why polymorphism eliminates if/else chains. Instead of checking types and branching, you call the method and let the object handle it in the way that makes sense for its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of OOP Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've covered all four OOP principles, here's how they work together for receipt parsing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Groups receipt data (merchant, items, totals) with methods that operate on it (validate, calculate, display). Prevents external code from creating invalid receipt states.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Hides parsing complexity behind simple interfaces. You call `calculate_total()` without knowing whether it uses addition, subtraction, or complex tax calculations internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: Eliminates code duplication. Common receipt fields and validation logic are written once in the base `Receipt` class and reused by `ServiceReceipt`, `GroceryReceipt`, and any future receipt types.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: Allows processing different receipt types uniformly. Write code that works with any receipt type without checking types or using if/else statements. Add new receipt types without modifying existing processing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these principles let you build a receipt parsing system that's organized, maintainable, and easy to extend as you encounter new receipt formats."
