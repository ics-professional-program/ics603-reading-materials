    "# 1  Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Jupyter Notebook** (file extension `.ipynb`) is a single, shareable document that blends executable code, narrative text, equations, and rich media. A jupyter notebook runs in the browser and allows you to write, and execute, and annotate your thought process in styled Markdown. Because notebooks run on every major operating system and are recognised by research labs, startups, and Fortune‑500 data teams alike, they have become the *lingua franca* of modern data science, machine learning, and technical education.\n",

    "A **Jupyter Notebook** is a single, shareable document in your web browser where you can mix runnable code, plain-language notes, maths, images and charts in whatever order tells the clearest story — no special desktop software required. It has become the go-to format for teaching, data science and exploratory programming because anyone with Jupyter installed can open the file and replay every step exactly as you wrote it.\n",

    "* **Why JSON matters.** Because JSON is pure text, tools such as Git can show *exactly* what changed when you edit a notebook, line by line, just like they would for a normal document.\n",

    "## 2 A User-Friendly Tour of the Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first open JupyterLab, the screen is thoughtfully organized into several key areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Toolbar\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very top, you’ll see buttons like **Run ▶**, **Stop ⏹**, **Restart ⟳**, and menus labeled *File*, *Edit*, *View*, *Run*, *Kernel*, *Settings*, and *Help*. These are non-coders’ shortcuts: instead of memorizing keyboard commands, you can click to run individual cells, restart your Python session, save your work, or export your notebook as a PDF. This visual interface ensures that you’re never left guessing what button to press.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell Gutter (Left Margin of Each Cell)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next to each cell, you’ll notice a narrow gray bar with labels like **In \\[ ]** or **In \\[3]**. This is known as the *cell gutter*. It serves two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Highlights which cell is currently selected.\n",
    "2. Tracks the order in which you've executed cells. The number inside the brackets increments as you run new cells, helping you keep tabs on whether your code is updating in the expected sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the gutter helps prevent confusion—no more wondering whether you forgot to run a certain cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sidebar & File Browser (Left Pane)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the far left, the sidebar displays a vertical set of icons—by default, featuring a folder icon, among others. Click the folder icon to open the File Browser, which shows all files in your current project folder. Here you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Double-click `.ipynb` notebooks, CSV, or script files to open them in new tabs.\n",
    "* Upload new data files or create folders.\n",
    "* Launch a terminal or see your running Python sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design lets you toggle between data, code, and visualizations without leaving the notebook—no app switching required.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Main Work Area (Center Workspace)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the real magic happens: your notebook lives here. You’ll create **cells**—blocks of code or formatted text—and run them one by one. Each cell can include Python code that executes immediately, or markdown text that renders into readable documentation. The interface feels like a powerful word processor designed especially for coding and explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Status Bar (Bottom)\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the bottom lies a thin bar showing important contextual info:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Kernel name** (“Python 3.13”) – tells you which programming language/environment is running.\n",
    "* **CPU/Memory usage** – helpful when working with large data or complex models.\n",
    "* **Connection indicators** – shows if your Python kernel is busy or disconnected.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your constant reassurance that code is running where you expect, and that your session is actively executing commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Tools Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clickable toolbar**: No one needs to remember `Shift + Enter`—just click Run and focus on ideas, not key combinations.\n",
    "* **Cell gutter numbering**: Helps you identify which cells haven’t been run yet, making debugging easier.\n",
    "* **Sidebar navigation**: Lets you manage data files, switch between notebooks or open terminals—all in a single window.\n",
    "* **Status bar feedback**: Gives you immediate awareness of the system you're working on and the notebook’s performance.\n",

    "2. Select a **cell** and inspect it—notice gutter highlighting.\n",
    "3. Click **Run ▶** to execute it; output appears right below the cell.\n",
    "4. Monitor the **status bar** to confirm the kernel is active and working.\n",
    "5. Use the **toolbar** and **menus** to restart the kernel, save, or export work as needed.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why this setup is the gold standard in 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transparent feedback** lets you see code execution and results side by side.\n",
    "* **Integrated data navigation** enables workflows that mix coding, exploration, and documentation—all without switching apps.\n",
    "* **Reproducibility** is built in: the order of cell execution, environment, and outputs are retained in a single shareable file.\n",
    "* **Industry-ready workflow**: as tools like VS Code’s Jupyter integration, Cursor, GitHub Codespaces, and WinSurf adopt the same interface patterns, every skill you build here transfers directly into modern professional environments.\n",
