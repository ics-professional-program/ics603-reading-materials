A jupyter notebook runs in the browser and allows you to write, and execute, and annotate your thought process in styled Markdown.

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Toolbar\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very top, you‚Äôll see buttons like **Run ‚ñ∂**, **Stop ‚èπ**, **Restart ‚ü≥**, and menus labeled *File*, *Edit*, *View*, *Run*, *Kernel*, *Settings*, and *Help*. These are non-coders‚Äô shortcuts: instead of memorizing keyboard commands, you can click to run individual cells, restart your Python session, save your work, or export your notebook as a PDF. This visual interface ensures that you‚Äôre never left guessing what button to press.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### Cell Gutter (Left Margin of Each Cell)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next to each cell, you‚Äôll notice a narrow gray bar with labels like **In‚ÄØ\\[ ]** or **In‚ÄØ\\[3]**. This is known as the *cell gutter*. It serves two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Highlights which cell is currently selected.\n",
    "2. Tracks the order in which you've executed cells. The number inside the brackets increments as you run new cells, helping you keep tabs on whether your code is updating in the expected sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the gutter helps prevent confusion‚Äîno more wondering whether you forgot to run a certain cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sidebar & File Browser (Left Pane)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the far left, the sidebar displays a vertical set of icons‚Äîby default, featuring a folder icon, among others. Click the folder icon to open the File Browser, which shows all files in your current project folder. Here you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Double-click `.ipynb` notebooks, CSV, or script files to open them in new tabs.\n",
