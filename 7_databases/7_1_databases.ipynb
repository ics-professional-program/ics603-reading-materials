    "Why not JSON files? JSON is the most commonly used file format for data interchange, and most data these days is delivered as JSON files. However, saving data as JSON makes it difficult to use in applications. For each query, the entire file must be read into memory and custom logic must be written to find the desired information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider these example queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Find all Starbucks receipts from January 1 to March 15 where the total is between $12 and less than $100 and that have at least 2 items\n",
    "    * Find all receipts where a transaction amount is more than $500\n",

    "While database engineers often access and manipulate databases manually through database management tools, building applications requires programmatic access. This course relies primarily on using SQLAlchemy ORM for database interaction. SQLAlchemy is installed using `pip`, the Python package manager, with the command `pip install sqlalchemy`, following the same process used for other Python packages. SQLAlchemy makes each Python class definition correspond to a database table. The concept of a table is similar to a spreadsheet. A database table contains related information grouped together. For example, an employee table might contain `first_name`, `last_name`, `age`, `department`, `address`, and `salary`. The concept of encapsulation applies here in the same way we covered in the OOP module. Another related table might contain employee paychecks, storing `paycheck_date`, `amount`, `deductions`, and `employee_ID` linking back to the employee table. This structure mirrors how information is encapsulated into classes in object-oriented programming. When data is grouped together logically in a Python class, that same class can be used as a database table definition.\n",

    "Applications require several key capabilities for effective data management. Data must survive when the program closes, a property known as persistence. The system must support searching and filtering through queries. Analyzing trends over time requires aggregation functions, such as averaging all receipt totals by month or calculating the median item value. Ideally, these operations should be possible without writing a specialized query language, though the ability to use SQL when needed remains valuable. Finally, data access must extend beyond the local machine, enabling queries from web applications or other remote environments.\n",
    "SQLAlchemy ORM addresses these requirements. ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping, a technique where Python class definitions correspond directly to database tables. This approach eliminates the need to write SQL strings, allowing developers to work entirely in Python.\n",

    "Setting up database interaction requires importing the correct modules and classes and creating a connection to the database. For simplicity, this course uses `SQLite`, a widely used database management system for prototyping and testing. `SQLite` creates the database in a single file that contains everything needed to store and interact with data.\n",
    "\n",

This establishes the foundation for the ORM mapping. The session acts as a workspace for making changes to the database, similar to a transaction in which operations can be grouped together before being committed.

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from datetime import date\n",

    "class Receipt(Base):\n",
    "    __tablename__ = 'receipts'\n",
    "    \n",

    "    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
    "    merchant = Column(String, nullable=False)\n",
    "    total = Column(Float, nullable=False)\n",
    "    date = Column(Date, default=date.today)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code performs several operations. The `__tablename__` attribute specifies the name of the table in the database. Each `Column()` definition creates a database field, functioning like class attributes but with database-specific properties (this is similar to columns in the spreadsheet analogy). Column types map Python data types to database types: `Integer` for whole numbers (like the id field), `String` for text (like merchant), `Float` for decimal numbers (like total), and `Date` for date values. The `primary_key=True` parameter designates the id field as a unique identifier that auto-increments with each new record. The `nullable=False` parameter marks a field as required, preventing `None` values. The `default=date.today` parameter provides an automatic value when none is specified. Finally, `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)` executes the actual table creation in the database, translating the Python class definition into the corresponding database schema.\n"

This section explores how to add both instance methods and class methods to enhance the Receipt class.\n",

SQLAlchemy provides these advanced querying capabilities without requiring SQL knowledge, maintaining the Python-based approach established in the previous section.\n",
